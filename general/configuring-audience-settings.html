    <h2 id="retention">Setting the data retention period</h2>
    <p>Set the default data retention period for the account. This value can be changed when new connections are created. The data retention policy determines how long the viewing data and lead form data (if using an Audience lead form) will be retained in your Video Cloud account. Retaining data in Video Cloud allows you to recover from interrupted synchronizations. Also, Audience will continue to retry events that fail to sync (usually because the viewer isn't a known contact at the time they viewed a video) until the event ages past the data retention period. <strong>You should adjust the retention settings according to your privacy policy</strong> - it is not required to retain any user data in Video Cloud.</p>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Audience Tracking, Custom and SSO connections can be configured to retain data for up to 3 years. Longer data retention periods for those connections can be selected when configuring the connection.</aside>
