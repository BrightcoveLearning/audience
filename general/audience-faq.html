  <h1>Brightcove Audience FAQ</h1>
  <summary>This topic contains some of the common questions asked about Brightcove Audience.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section" id="why-how">
    <h2>Why Audience & How it Works</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">Why do I need to track video in my marketing automation solution?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">Marketing automation solutions do not track video today. If you are investing in video as a powerful piece of content, you should make sure you are tracking its effectiveness and automating communication with leads/users who view your content. </dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">Does Brightcove and the Audience module make use of any cookies?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">The Audience module creates and uses a 3rd party cookie to identify users so that viewers don’t get asked to fill out a lead form a second time. The module also makes use of Marketo and Eloqua APIs which themselves use cookies to track viewers.</dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">Does Brightcove and the Audience module make use of any cookies?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">The Audience module creates and uses a 3rd party cookie to identify users when an integration is in place.  This way viewers don’t get asked to fill out a lead form a second time. The module also makes use of Marketo, HubSpot and Eloqua APIs which themselves use cookies to track viewers.  When using Audience Profiles we use a Brightcove cookie.</dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">Does every Brightcove customer get this product?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">No. Audience is available as a Purchasable Add-on to Video Marketing Suite customers.  Audience Profiles, however, is available to every Brightcove customer for free.  You can think of it as “Audience-lite”</dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">Who is eligible for Audience Profiles.</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">Starting Q4 2017 every VMS customer will have access to Audience Profiles at no cost.  They will need to activate it to start tracking data.  EVS customers will have Audience SSO tracking available to them as well.</dd>

    <h2>Viewer Tracking & Limitations</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">What limitations does Audience Profiles have compared to the full-blown Audience?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">No integrating with any third party systems, no API access, no custom forms (Audience form only), 1000 views/24 hour period capture cap.  You can still manually export your data to a CSV or XLS file.</dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">What limitations does Audience have when connected to a marketing automation platform?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">???</dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">Are there any limits on how often the Audience API can be polled? I know there's a 1000 cap on video search results, but are there other frequency related caps to that API endpoint? </dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">The max # of view events per API call is actually 100. There’s no rate limiting in place that I know of but if you tried to call it too much it’d probably slow down quote a bit. The golf channel had trouble getting out lots of data via the API. In fact they couldn’t get it out faster than they were putting it in.</dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">Is there any way to get Audience data faster than the 3 hour delay that is currently present? They want real-time metrics and can't get that with the Audience analytics.</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">No. If they want real-time metrics they’d need to write their own plugin and send data to their own system.</dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">What is the trigger for an event view to be sent to Audience's data? Is it when the video completes, or if the player window is closed, or something else? What happens if the user never completes the video and doesn't close their player window?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">It varies but basically the Audience plugin sends a heartbeat back to the server every 10 seconds.</dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">When does audience consider tracking on a view to be "completed"- Is it when the player window is closed, or if they complete the video? What happens if they watch part way through, pause the video and never close the player window?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">it’s when 15 minutes have passed since we last say a heart beat, basically lack of activity.</dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">Is it possible for viewer data to change once it's available in the Audience viewing data? Will that event data ever be updated in the future my some kind of log consolidation? </dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">Once the data is available in Audience via UI or API it’s “settled” it’s not going to change.</dd>

    <h2>Data protection & record retention</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">Is Audience GDPR compliant?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">
        <p>Yes, Audience gives customers the ability to act on behalf of their users, looking up and purging any data they’ve collected via Audience. </p>

      </dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">How long can data be retained in Audience?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">MAP integrations can be set to a maximum of 6 months and non-MAP integrations can be set to 3 years. </dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">How long are GUID lookups cached?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">30 days for known and 7 days for unknown (only applies to MAP integrations, no lookups needed for non-MAP integrations)</dd>

    <h2>Marketing automation & viewer analytics</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">What is different about tracking video from any other media in my marketing automation platform?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">As opposed to a webpage or downloadable white paper, with a video, you can know exactly how much of the video they watched and therefore exactly what content they have been exposed to. </dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">How do you connect with my Eloqua/Marketo/Hubspot account?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">You are able to log into your Eloqua/Marketo/HubSpot account directly through the Video Marketing Suite in the Audience module. From there you are able to create players and lead forms with MAP tracking built in so you can start tracking video analytics immediately.</dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">Can I track views on my Eloqua/Marketo/HubSpot pages as well as my non-Eloqua/Marketo/HubSpot landing pages (sitecore/Wordpress/Gallery etc)? </dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">Yes, as long as the player being used is “Audience enabled” (has the Audience plugin installed) all view will be tracked whether it resides on a MAP landing page or any other landing page. </dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">What can I track with this integration?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">With our integration, you can track video viewing analytics (video, video ID, percent viewed, time watched) for known contacts already in your database.</dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">What about unknown contacts?  Can I track them too?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">With our integration, you can track unknown contacts and then when they submit an Eloqua/HubSpot form, we are able to associate their viewership information with that new contact retroactively. Audience resubmits viewership information daily to match view data from unknown contacts back to your Oracle Eloqua/HubSpot instance. </dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">Where will my video-view data show up in my MAP?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">This depends on which MAP you are using.  See the following documentation for Oracle Eloqua, Marketo and HubSpot </dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">Where in Salesforce will my video viewing data show up?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">Video views are delivered into Salesforce as a task under the viewer’s contact in the Activity section. See “Viewing video data in Salesforce for an example of this. </dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">Can I be notified with SalesForce when one of my contacts has watched videos?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">Not directly.  However, you can run reports that would notify you of a contact’s activity.</dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">Is there any difference between tracking with Salesforce vs. Oracle Eloqua/Marketo?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">The biggest difference is that Salesforce does not use Cookies to track users.  Therefore the customer must manually provide a unique identifier.  See this documentation for more info.  Additionally, SalesForce, being a CRM does not offer automated follow-ups or lead scoring.  However, you can create tasks in SalesForce which are then assigned to your sales team for real-life follow-ups.</dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">Audience has a “Custom” integration option, what other platforms can Audience integrate with using this?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">
        <p>Audience can “integrate” with any data platform that:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Uses a unique identifier for each contact record</li>
          <li>Has an API that can receive additional data from third-party platforms (like Audience)</li>
        </ol>
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </section>
  <section id="lead-forms" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>Player Lead Forms</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">When does Audience display a lead-capture form?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">The default setting only displays the lead-capture form to an unknown user in your MAP database (the ones you want to convert into a known user).  You can override this in the settings if you choose to always display the lead-form.  This is most useful for testing.  Known users are automatically tracked and that data is associated with the contact in your MAP without the need to display a form.</dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">Can I customize Brightcove forms?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">You can adjust the text and fields displayed per the UI.  You can not modify it beyond what is available in the UI (Gallery can update some styling to make the forms match the site) </dd>
    </dl>

  <section id="general" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>General topics</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">Which embed code should I use? Iframe or in-page?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">For Audience to work it is required that the “Advanced” embed code is used.  If the “Standard” (or iFrame) embed code is used, then the player is isolated from the page which means the Audience plugin cannot see the unique identifier and thus all users will be seen as “unknown”. </dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">What is marketing automation?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">Marketing automation is a technology that tracks lead/user interaction with different online marketing channels (email, web, forms, content, video, social...etc.), help them market more effectively across these channels, and automate repetitive marketing tasks (such as email communications). Marketing automation allows the marketer to setup automated and personalized tasks based on predefined variables. 
        For Example: If a user watches 75% of a specific video, send them an email on that specific subject but if they only watch 12% send them something else. </dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">Is Brightcove a marketing automation company?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">No, Brightcove provides a complete solution for video marketing. With our solution, you can get your videos online, organize your content, create players, create video portals, track analytics...and integrate with your own existing marketing automation platform. We integrate video analytics into marketing automation platforms.</dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">How can I check to see if a customer’s Marketo custom activity is setup correctly?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">Audience has a “hidden” URL which offers some debug tools for certain kinds of integrations, Marketo REST being one.
        
        https://studio.brightcove.com/products/videocloud/audience/debug </dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">What does the customer have to do for a custom integration?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">They will need to do three things.
        Expose a unique identifier in the URL or code of the page that Audience can capture
        Write (or use BGS’s services) a script that makes use of our Audience API’s to retrieve the data as a JSON file
        Map that data to fields that they have created in their destination-database (think spreadsheet merge)
        If a customer is interested in setting up a custom integration send them the following support documentation to review and assess if they can do it on their own or if they need additional help.
        
        Creating Custom Integrations with the Audience Module: https://support.brightcove.com/creating-custom-integrations-audience-module - This is how you will provide a unique identifier that Audience can capture.
        Audience API: https://support.brightcove.com/audience-api  - This is how you’d programmatically retrieve all the data as a JSON file which you can then import into your data processing system of choice. </dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">How does Audience push CDO data to Eloqua?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">We use the custom object bulk API.
        https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCAC/api-bulk-2.0-customobjects.html </dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">How does Audience push the external asset activity? How can I control the Campaign, External Asset and Activity Types used?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">We using the external activity API.
        https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCAC/op-api-rest-2.0-data-activity-post.html
        
        There's no control over the name of the campaign, asset name or type. We simply create a campaign on our own (named BrightcoveVideoPlay) and then proceed to create activities also named BrightcoveVideoPlay. </dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question language-editable">What IP addresses can I whitelist so that Audience can talk to service X?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer language-editable">See the IP whitelist mentioned above </dd>
